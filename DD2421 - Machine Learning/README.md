## Assignments
Final grade (including written exam) : A
The lab work for this course was related to SVMs, Decision trees and Naive Bayes and the code can not be shared publically.
There was also a "MLCHALLENGE" part of the course in which one was tasked with a classification task. This task consisted of data cleaning and training a classifier to infer labels.
The given data set consisted of 1000 labelled, 13 dimensional data points, and one was tasked with handing in inferred labels for a significantly larger unlabelled data set.
Code (which resulted in maximum points) for the assignment can be found in the notebook.
